# Data Sources

A data source is a definition of an external connection. You must fill
out a data source for external SQL servers like MySQL or PostgreSQL so
you can query them in a [Database panel](./Panels/Database_Panels.md).

# With Server

A data source can be definied as being proxied through an SSH tunnel
by checking the **With Server** option. Once selected, you will be
prompted to pick from one of the [SSH connections](./SSH_Connections.md) you set up
previously.
