# MacOS

Download [darwin-x64-0.2.0.zip](https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/releases/download/0.2.0/darwin-x64-0.2.0.zip) and unzip. You will need to right-click
the application to click Open so you can run the untrusted

"Don't run", click "More info" and click "Run anyway". There may be a
few second long security scan the first time you run.

# Linux
