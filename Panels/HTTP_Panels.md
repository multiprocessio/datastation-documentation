# HTTP Panels

These panels allow you to making API requests. You can make GET, POST,
PUT, HEAD, or DELETE requests.

# With Server

HTTP requests can be proxied through an SSH tunnel by checking the
**With Server** option. Once selected, you will be prompted to pick from
one of the [SSH connections](../SSH_Connections) you set up previously.
