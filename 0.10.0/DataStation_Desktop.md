# Installation

DataStation can run as either a desktop application or as a server
application. You will need to have an OIDC provider if you want to run
the server application. The server application comes with the ability
to run and email reports daily, weekly, or monthly. It also comes with
support for read-only dashboards.

# Desktop

Pre-built binaries are provided for 64-bit x86 machines running macOS,
Windows, and Linux.

## MacOS

Download [datastation-darwin-x64-0.10.0.zip](https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/releases/download/0.10.0/datastation-darwin-x64-0.10.0.zip) and unzip. You will need to right-click
the application to click Open so you can run the untrusted
application.

## Windows

Download [datastation-win32-x64-0.10.0.zip](https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/releases/download/0.10.0/datastation-win32-x64-0.10.0.zip) and unzip. If you get a warning saying
"Don't run", click "More info" and click "Run anyway". There may be a
few second long security scan the first time you run.

## Linux

Download [datastation-linux-x64-0.10.0.zip](https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/releases/download/0.10.0/datastation-linux-x64-0.10.0.zip) and unzip.

## Other

Other systems and architectures may be supported but you will need to
build them yourself. Follow [instructions in the repo](https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/blob/main/HACKING.md).

## Light mode/Dark mode

To toggle light or dark mode in the desktop application, you'll need
go to the View menu and click Settings. Switch to the mode you want
and then quit DataStation and start it again.
