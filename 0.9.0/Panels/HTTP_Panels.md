# HTTP Panels

HTTP panels allow you to make API requests. You can make GET, POST,
PUT, HEAD, or DELETE requests.

# Macros

The URL, headers, and HTTP body in an HTTP panel can include
macros. This allows you to, for example, POST the results of one panel
to a web server.

# With Server

If you define an [SSH connections](./SSH_Connections.md) you will be
able to select the server to proxy your HTTP request through an
SSH tunnel.
