# Data Sources

A data source is a definition of an external connection. You must fill
out a data source for external SQL servers like MySQL or PostgreSQL so
you can query them in a [Database panel](./Panels/Database_Panels.md).

You do not need to define a data source for files and HTTP endpoints.

# With Server

If you have defined any [SSH Connections](./SSH_Connections.md) you
will be able to select from them to proxy your database connection
through an SSH tunnel.
