# SSH Connections

An SSH connection is all the configuration needed to connect to a
server running SSH. Once a connection is set up, it can be used in
File panels, HTTP panels, and SQL panels to access remote data that
you wouldn't otherwise be able to.

You can connect using either a username/password combination or an SSH
private key file.
